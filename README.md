# Spotify_stats
This is a repository made for my university programming course. 
### I recieved instructions:
The database is to be realized in the form of a list. It should be provided
Adding and removing songs to the list and generating a report to *.txt file.
The application should allow statistical analysis on
Artists listened to using Spotify application:
- Display the name of the artist who had the most listens
- Sort artists according to their popularity
- Calculate the minimum and maximum of each measure
- Calculate the arithmetic mean of individual measures
- Calculate Spearman correlation between individual variables.
For the purpose of the project, please randomly assign the received data to
specific regions of the world: Asia, America, Africa, Europe.
Available data file.

Project was supposed to be made in C++, but because I wanted completely focus on C# my proffessor agreeded to make it in C#. In repo you can also find some of my C++ exercises done during the course.
